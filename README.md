<H1> Shared Perspectives for Query by Example in E-Commerce </H1>

This is the code for my master thesis at TUDelft, where I try to introduce a level of perception-based 
personalization to the process of Query by Example for experience items, such as books and movies, in E-Commerce platforms.

The concepts can be simplified to be quite straightforward, if we can encode user feedback (such as reviews) into tuples, 
and we apply a clustering algorithm on the tuples for every item, we get Shared Perspectives (SPs).
Then the Shared Perspective Tuples, center of those SPs, can be the representation of the item in a Query by Example, 
so a system is able to find the items with most similar experiences by users.
